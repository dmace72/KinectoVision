Detailed Explanation of the Kinect Capture Program
The purpose of this program is to capture both color and depth images from a Kinect sensor and save them to your computer.

Key Components
Namespaces: The program uses several namespaces:

System: Basic classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types.
System.Drawing: Provides access to GDI+ basic graphics functionality.
System.Drawing.Imaging: Provides advanced GDI+ imaging functionality.
System.IO: Provides types for reading and writing to files and data streams.
Microsoft.Kinect: Provides classes and methods for accessing Kinect sensor data.
Class Program: Contains the main logic of the application.

Static Fields:
KinectSensor sensor: Represents the Kinect sensor.
MultiSourceFrameReader reader: Reads multiple types of frames from the Kinect sensor (color and depth).
string colorImagePath: Path to save the captured color image.
string depthImagePath: Path to save the captured depth image.
Main Method:

Directory Check and Creation: Ensures that the directory C:\KinectData exists. If it doesn't, the directory is created.
Kinect Sensor Initialization:
The program attempts to get the default Kinect sensor.
If no sensor is detected, it outputs a message and exits.
If a sensor is found, it is opened.
Frame Reader Initialization:
Initializes a MultiSourceFrameReader to read both color and depth frames from the Kinect sensor.
Subscribes to the MultiSourceFrameArrived event, which is triggered whenever a new frame arrives.
Keep Console Open: The program waits for a key press before closing the sensor and exiting, ensuring it stays open to receive frames.
Event Handler Reader_MultiSourceFrameArrived:

This method is called whenever a new multi-source frame (color + depth) arrives.
Frame Acquisition:
Attempts to acquire the multi-source frame reference.
If the frame reference is null, it exits the method.
Color Frame Handling:
Acquires the color frame and retrieves its description.
Converts the color frame data to a byte array in BGRA format.
Creates a Bitmap from the color frame data and saves it as a JPEG file.
Depth Frame Handling:
Acquires the depth frame and retrieves its description.
Copies the depth frame data to a ushort array.
Data Conversion: Converts the ushort array to a byte array, scaling down the values to fit within the byte range.
Bitmap Creation:
Creates a grayscale Bitmap with an 8-bit indexed pixel format.
Sets a grayscale palette for the bitmap.
Copies the byte array to the bitmap's pixel data and saves it as a JPEG file.
